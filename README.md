# FunGuy-Source-for-version-below-2.0
The source code for the discord bot FunGuy.

This contains a bit of the code for FunGuy 2.0.
You will need some setup before running the code.
I changed the code a bit so it works with replit.com database
I recommend running the code in replit.
Create some environment variables (like 1 for token, etc.) Not sure how much env vars are needed. I guess run and see if any errors.

Made in Python by the way.
